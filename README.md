This project is a Java-based ATM system built with a strong emphasis on backend processing and security. At its core, the BankServer handles user authentication, account management, and transaction execution using a client–server architecture over TCP sockets. Clients (ATM terminals) connect through a BankGateway, which forwards encrypted requests to the server. On the backend, the server integrates with a SQLite database via the JDBC driver, managed by the DatabaseManager class, to store and update user records (usernames, passwords/PINs, balances). Data persistence relies on SQL queries for insert, update, and retrieval.
Security is a critical backend feature; therefore, all communication between client and server uses AES encryption for confidentiality and Message Authentication Codes (MAC) for integrity, with nonces and timestamps to prevent replay attacks. A key derivation process establishes per-session keys from a shared master secret. Each server-side operation—login, withdraw, deposit, balance inquiry—is logged into an encrypted audit log, ensuring accountability while protecting sensitive details; the system also supports a decrypted version for audits.
The backend server manages concurrent client sessions by spawning threads for multiple ATM connections, ensuring responsiveness. It also enforces object-oriented design principles, separating concerns across classes: the BankServer orchestrates transactions, DatabaseManager encapsulates database access, Encryption centralizes cryptographic operations, and User provides a structured model for account data. Supporting scripts (compile.bat, run_server.bat, run_client.bat) streamline compilation and deployment.
In essence, this project demonstrates a complete backend system combining secure client–server networking, relational database integration, cryptographic protocols, concurrency handling, and structured logging, making it a strong showcase of backend development and security engineering in Java.
